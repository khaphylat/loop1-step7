                            someone of the opposite sex is something that runs
                            deep within everyone, even though most people don't
                            take the time to find someone who truly respect
                            them. It seems like people are just looking for
                            someone to show them the slightest amount of
                            attention, settling for something much less than
                            respest. I am convinced one of the best ways to help
                            any relationship grow is by showing respect.

                            I have come to the conclussion that everyone longs
                            to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing
                            someone extra special attention, or high regard,
                            based on a desire to show them how highly they are
                            valued.
